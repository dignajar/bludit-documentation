Content: This is the configuration to run Bludit over Nginx web server.

> NGINX is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. NGINX is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption. https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/

In order to set up a new virtual host for Bludit, generate a new file with the configuration in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/bludit.conf`, this directory could be different in other distributions of GNU/Linux, for example, in Ubuntu will be `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/bludit.conf`.

In this case, Bludit files are in `/var/www/html/bludit`, you can change the directory path in the configuration file.

```
server {
	listen 80;
	server_name bludit.local;

	charset utf-8;
	root /var/www/html/bludit;

	index index.php;
	try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$args;

	access_log /var/log/nginx/bludit_access.log;
	error_log /var/log/nginx/bludit_error.log;

	location ~ \.php$ {
		try_files $uri =404;
		fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
		fastcgi_index index.php;
		include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
		fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
	}

	# if file does not exist, rewrite to index.php
	if (!-f $request_filename) {
		rewrite ^/(.*) /index.php break;
	}
}
